## 🚀 Usage

### Add FedEx Tracking Number

1. Edit a WooCommerce order.
2. Enter the tracking number in the **Track Shipment** section.
3. Save the order.

### Email Notification

- When a tracking number is saved, the customer will automatically receive an email containing the initial tracking details.
- Customers will receive an email notification every time the shipment status updates (e.g., in transit, out for delivery, delivered).

## ⚠️ Limitations

- ❌ No real-time tracking or FedEx webhook support.
- 📧 Email notifications are sent only when a tracking number is added and when the shipment status updates (e.g., in transit, out for delivery, delivered).
